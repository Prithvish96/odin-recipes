# Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is my first project for The Odin Project, where I built a simple recipe website to practice HTML fundamentals and CSS styling. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating structured web pages, linking them together, and applying external CSS to style the content.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

1. **Homepage**: An `index.html` file that serves as the main page of the website, featuring a heading and links to various recipe pages.
2. **Recipe Pages**: Individual pages for each recipe, containing images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.
3. **Styling**: External CSS files have been added to style the recipe pages and practice CSS properties.

## Phases and Features

### Phase 1: Initial Structure

- Created the `index.html` file within the `odin-recipes` directory.
- Added basic HTML boilerplate and a main heading `<h1>` with the text "Odin Recipes".

### Phase 2: Recipe Page

- Created a `recipes` directory within the `odin-recipes` folder.
- Added a new HTML file for each recipe in the `recipes` directory.
- Included an `<h1>` heading on each recipe page with the recipeâ€™s name.
- Linked each recipe page from the `index.html` file with appropriate anchor tags `<a>`.

### Phase 3: Recipe Page Content

- Added the following content to each recipe page:
  - An image of the finished dish.
  - A "Description" section with a paragraph describing the recipe.
  - An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list of ingredients.
  - A "Steps" section with an ordered list detailing the steps to prepare the dish.

### Phase 4: Adding More Recipes

- Created two additional recipe pages following the same structure.
- Updated the `index.html` file to include links to the new recipes in an unordered list.

### Phase 5: Adding CSS Styling

- Added external CSS files to style the recipe pages.
- Implemented various CSS properties, including color, background color, and typography, to practice styling.
- Focused on using web-safe fonts and basic styling techniques to improve the visual appearance of the pages.

## Skills Learned and Applied

### HTML

- **Page Structure**: Learned to create and structure HTML documents, including headings, links, images, lists, and paragraphs.
- **Linking Pages**: Gained experience in linking multiple pages together to create a cohesive website.

### CSS

- **External CSS**: Practiced using external CSS to style HTML elements, improving separation of content and presentation.
- **Styling Properties**: Experimented with CSS properties such as color, background color, and typography.
- **Web-Safe Fonts**: Utilized web-safe fonts to ensure consistent text rendering across different devices.

### Project Organization

- **File Structure**: Developed an understanding of organizing project files into directories for better manageability.
- **Content Structuring**: Learned to organize content into clear sections and lists to improve readability and user experience.

## Challenges and Reflections

- **Linking Pages**: Initially found it challenging to manage links between multiple pages, but successfully implemented a navigation system by creating links in the `index.html` file.
- **Styling**: Gained confidence in using CSS, though the primary goal was to practice styling rather than achieving a polished look.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Styling**: Plan to enhance the design further with more advanced CSS techniques and possibly incorporate custom fonts.
- **Accessibility**: Aim to improve accessibility by incorporating best practices such as semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

## Conclusion

This project has been an excellent introduction to web development with The Odin Project. Adding CSS to style the pages has been a valuable learning experience. I am excited to build on these skills and take on more complex projects in the future. Thank you for checking out my work!
