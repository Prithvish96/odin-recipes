Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is my first project for The Odin Project, where I built a simple recipe website to practice HTML fundamentals.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating structured web pages and linking them together.

Project Overview
This project includes:

Homepage: An index.html file that serves as the main page of the website, featuring a heading and links to various recipe pages.

Recipe Pages: Individual pages for each recipe, containing images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.

Phases and Features

Phase 1: Initial Structure

Created the index.html file within the odin-recipes directory.
Added basic HTML boilerplate and a main heading <h1> with the text "Odin Recipes".

Phase 2: Recipe Page

Created a recipes directory within the odin-recipes folder.
Added a new HTML file for each recipe (e.g., lasagna.html) in the recipes directory.
Included an <h1> heading on each recipe page with the recipeâ€™s name.
Linked each recipe page from the index.html file with appropriate anchor tags <a>.

Phase 3: Recipe Page Content

Added the following content to each recipe page:
An image of the finished dish.
A "Description" section with a paragraph describing the recipe.
An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list of ingredients.
A "Steps" section with an ordered list detailing the steps to prepare the dish.

Phase 4: Adding More Recipes

Created two additional recipe pages following the same structure.
Updated the index.html file to include links to the new recipes in an unordered list.

Skills Learned and Applied

HTML

Page Structure: Learned to create and structure HTML documents, including headings, links, images, lists, and paragraphs.

Linking Pages: Gained experience in linking multiple pages together to create a cohesive website.

Project Organization

File Structure: Developed an understanding of organizing project files into directories for better manageability.

Content Structuring: Learned to organize content into clear sections and lists to improve readability and user experience.

Challenges and Reflections

Linking Pages: Initially found it challenging to manage links between multiple pages, but successfully implemented a navigation system by creating links in the index.html file.

Content Layout: Ensuring consistent formatting and layout across different recipe pages required attention to detail.

Future Enhancements

Styling: Plan to enhance the design with advanced CSS techniques to make the site visually appealing.

Accessibility: Aim to improve accessibility by incorporating best practices such as semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.

Conclusion

This project has been an excellent introduction to web development with The Odin Project. I am excited to build on these skills and take on more complex projects in the future. Thank you for checking out my work!
